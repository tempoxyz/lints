id: prefer-const
message: "Use 'const' instead of 'let' when variable is never reassigned."
severity: hint

note: |
  `const` signals intent that a variable won't be reassigned.
  It helps prevent accidental reassignment bugs.
  
  Note: This is a simple syntactic check. Use ESLint's prefer-const
  for more sophisticated analysis.
  
  To disable this rule:
  - Line: add `// ast-grep-ignore: prefer-const` on the line before
rule:
  pattern: let $NAME = $VALUE;
  not:
    follows:
      pattern: $NAME = $OTHER
